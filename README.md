# mouse-cursor-resetter
Created to be able to play Metroid Prime: Hunters in an emulator using a keyboard and mouse.

### Starting the program
This program is currently only for the Windows operating system, and has only been tested on Windows 10 and 11.
It is an executable and can therefore be run like any other Windows executable.
When starting the program, a large black CMD window will appear, this is normal and it will display debugging information. 
You can minimize this window and still use the program normally.

### Stopping the looping
While the program is looping your mouse, press the "m" key to stop looping. You may have to press the key multiple times.
